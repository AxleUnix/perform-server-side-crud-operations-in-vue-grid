# Perform Server-Side CRUD Operations in Vue Grid

A quick-start project that demonstrates how to create a simple ASP.NET Core application with Vue as a client app using a SPA template. This project contains code snippets to perform CRUD operations on the server side using the properties updateUrl, insertUrl, removeUrl, crudUrl, and batchUrl from the DataManager.
